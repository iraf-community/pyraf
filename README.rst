PyRAF is a command language for running IRAF tasks in a Python like
environment. It works very similar to IRAF, but has been updated to
allow such things as importing Python modules, starting in any
directory, GUI parameter editing and help. Most importantly, it can be
imported into Python allowing you to run IRAF commands from within a
larger script.
